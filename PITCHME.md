- __Cluttered Market:__ There are billions of websites in a limited number of niches. How will you make your website stand out amongst the rest?  SEO is just one way to help you rise to the top, but it is not enough. You have to find ways to provide unique and valuable content, you have to have an original voice, and you have to engage people. Everything has already been done, so there’s no use in trying to reinvent the wheel. You can’t be outrageous or goofy because that bar is already too high. Ditto for shocking or controversial. Instead, focus on giving your readers what they really need. Provide them solutions to their problems. Talk about the things they care about. Make emotional appeals.

- __More Ad Blockers:__ The use of ad blocking software is growing exponentially,and the people who are not using them will soon be in the minority. That presents a big challenge for marketers, who will have a hard time getting people to even see their ads, let alone to act on them.

- __Increased Ad Costs:__ There is more competition than ever for advertising, and networks like Google and Facebook are pushing up prices across the board. For competitive niches, you’ll have to pay a lot more this year.
